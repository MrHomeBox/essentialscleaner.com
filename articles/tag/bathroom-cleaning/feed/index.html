<p>You’ve just settled down in a comfy chair with your favorite cup of java and get an alert on your phone. Unexpected guests are coming over and you have little time to prepare. It is the nightmare scenario we have all faced a time or two. If it has been an exceptionally busy day or week, you feel the stress settle in and are now noticing all of the spots around your house that are not ‘guest ready.’</p>
<p>If you have run low on any of your products and are pressed for time, we have solutions for you! Having a few useful cleaning tips utilizing items laying around your home can help make your process quick and easy. Of course, you always have the option to <a href="https://www.essentialscleaner.com/book/"><strong>check into a service</strong></a> that will eliminate all of your need to worry as well&#8230;</p>
<h2><strong>Coca-Cola Removes Tough Stains</strong></h2>
<p>This classic soda is loaded with phosphoric and carbonic acid which makes it super effective in busting through rust and hard stains. One of the best locations to test this out is in your bathroom. Grab a can of Coke and pour it around the rim of your toilet allowing it to flow down into the bowl. Let this sit while you focus on other areas of the house. Upon returning, you can use your toilet wand to scrub off any stubborn stains that have not already dissolved. Flush and you’re done!</p>
<h2><strong>Grapefruit and Salt for a Sparkling Tub and Sink…with a Bonus!</strong></h2>
<p>You have probably read about the cleansing power of lemon and vinegar; it’s all true. Grapefruit, however, is just as effective and leaves behind a bright citrus scent in its wake. It is important to note that while it is a great cleaning agent for grime, it does not have antibacterial properties and should not be used as a substitute for areas where bacteria might abound. If you have tub rings or sink stains, simply slice your grapefruit in half, sprinkle salt on both the fruit and the surface you intend to clean, and scrub vigorously. The rind can be used against particularly stubborn areas. Rinse away the remaining salt and pulp with warm or hot water, and voila!</p>
<blockquote><p><em>BONUS: Your used grapefruit halves can be boiled in water for a few minutes before tossing out to add diffused fragrance to the air (do not eat/drink!) or dropped down your kitchen garbage disposal to freshen/clean the piping and blades.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Coffee Filters for Clean Screens</strong></h2>
<p>Coffee filters are a perfect substitute for traditional feather dusters and can do an even better job at leaving behind a shiny surface. Because of their rippled surface and anti-static properties, you can use fresh filters on just about any screen in your home; television, tablet, phone, laptop, computer, and more. Run them across wooden surfaces – especially dark colors – to watch the dust lift off in an instant with a streak and lint free sparkle.</p>
<h2><strong>Eliminate Grease and Smudges with White Bread</strong></h2>
<p>Do not toss out stale bread or unwanted end-pieces! The sponge-like surface is loaded with gluten that can absorb grease, dirt, and stains. Notice fingerprints or grease on your kitchen walls? Gently dab and brush the surface with a piece of bread and watch those unwanted marks disappear. The perks do not end there! If you drop a glass object and it shatters, you can carefully press the slice down onto the tiny shards to help lift them for disposal.</p>
<h2><strong>Combat Dust with Dryer Sheets</strong></h2>
<p>Just like coffee filters, dryer sheets can bust through dust while making every room smell like fresh laundry! Take your sheets and run them along baseboards, blinds, chandeliers, light fixtures, and mirrors in order to lift and repel dust. Dryer sheets are so effective in preventing dust from resettling on your delicate surfaces, you will notice your need to swipe these spots will decrease overall.</p>
