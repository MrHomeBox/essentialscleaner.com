		<h2>House Cleaning in Phoenix</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s that time of year again in Phoenix, Arizona where many households are gearing up for a busy fall schedule. Kids are going to school, off to college, and work seems to always be demanding more and more time. It&#8217;s also that time of year where Phoenix experiences a lot of weather changes, from monsoons in August to the perfect weather in October. Essentials Cleaner is here to help with getting your cleaning schedule up and going to help easy the burden of your busy schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Here are a few tips on building a schedule for House Cleaning in Phoenix</strong></p>
<p>Home cleaning is a lot of work and it is easy to lose track and end up with a dirty home in only a matter of days. But house cleaning does not need to be difficult! If you plan out a clenaing schedule for your home, it will help you to keep the house clean without needing to put in those long cleaning Saturdays. With a cleaning routine, your house will not be perfect at once, but it will be clean most of the time. Keeping a clean home take time, repetition, and someone to complete the tasks. Here is a suggested cleaning schedule you can start with:</p>
<p>MONDAY [BATHROOMS]: Clean all your bathrooms. This includes cleaning the mirrors, counters, sinks, faucets, toilets, showers, and tubs. Make sure you wipe your way out of the bathroom to leave a clean floor.</p>
<p>TUESDAY [DUST]: Start at the top and dust your way down. It is usually best to use a microfiber cloth for the areas you can reach. For those higher surfaces, you may need an duster with an extension. Be sure to start at the top though! Otherwise, you will be creating more cleaning work for yourself.</p>
<p>WEDNESDAY [VACUUM]: Vacuum all the floors in your home. It can be quick and simple if you keep up on this task. Make sure you take the time to get all of the corners and crevices though.</p>
<p>THURSDAY [WASH FLOORS]: Wash all the floors in your home with a good product.</p>
<p>FRIDAY [SHEETS &amp; TOWELS]: Wash all the sheets and towels. Put the sheets back on beds and put towels away. This will help keep your bathrooms and beds smelling clean and fresh.</p>
<p>SATURDAY [REAL CLEANING]: Find any areas that are &#8220;getting behind&#8221; and get to work. Saturday is often times a good day to catch up on any tasks you didn’t get a chance to complete.</p>
<p>SUNDAY [NOTHING]: Relax and enjoy your day.</p>
<p>Want an Alternative to a Cleaning? Maybe it&#8217;s time for a house cleaning service.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have time to keep up with a cleaning schedule because of your own schedule, you can always book a cleaning online through our website or you can give us a call. You can be confident when booking with Essentials Cleaner because the cleaners are background checked, we have a 200% happiness guarantee, no contracts, no upselling, straight forward pricing, insured cleanings, instant online scheduling, easy online payment, and awesome customer service.</p>

		<h2>5 Steps to De-clutter Your Dresser</h2>
<p>HOW TO:</p>
<p>1. Start with a Clean Slate</p>
<p>Get started by clearing everything off from the dresser top. Often times this works best by placing everything in an empty laundry basket or box. All done? Awesome! You probably had more stuff on there than you thought! Take a look at all that stuff in your basket. Now you know what you’re working with and what needs to stay and what needs to go.</p>
<p>2. Dump the Trash<br />
Take all of the stuff that belongs in the garbage and put it there! Do it quickly too, otherwise it might end up in a different spot in your home.</p>
<p>3. Dust, Clean, &amp; Polish<br />
Take a couple minutes to wipe down the dresser top and sides. Give some special attention to any areas that have built up dust or stains.</p>
<p>4. Return Items to Their Correct Place<br />
Now look back in your basket and start putting things where they belong. Some of those items may need to be placed right back on your dresser, but this time they will stand free of the other junk that was originally there.</p>
<p>5. Make it a Habit<br />
It will be easy to let your dresser get cluttered back up. Come up with a simple plan to keep clutter off your dresser! This can be done by having a “junk drawer” or a decorative dish that where you can place your smaller items such as keys, lip balm, etc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Cleaning Your Home Makes You Healthier</h3>
<p>When trying to avoid sickness cleanliness is basic. There is of course factors outside our homes that will inevitably lead to sickness a couple times a year, if not more. The fact of life is that you will get sick, and if you do not take the appropriate measures the rest of your family will get sick too. Getting sick may be inevitable, but you can always prevent disease from spreading by disinfecting surfaces and following healthy habits.</p>
<p>You probably already know that hand-washing is the single most efficient way to prevent the spreading of illnesses like the common cold. What you might be forgetting is that in most homes people use the same towels to dry everyone’s hands. Hand towels should be replaced as often as possible during this time to avoid spreading bugs around. Consider paper using paper towels as well; this is not a very ecologically friendly approach, but it is an option to be considered.</p>
<p>Our second recommendation would be to maintain a clean bathroom. After all that is where most of us will be washing our hands. Keep your sink handles and toilets clean to avoid more cross contamination. Another good idea would be to limit yourself to use one bathroom and avoid maintain this habit until everybody is feeling better.</p>
<p>If you have little ones that have fallen ill, a good thing to do would be to clean and disinfect toys and play areas. You may do this on a regular basis already, but it is especially important to maintain toys and common areas disinfected. Along with the idea of cleaning toys, make sure the “toys” of the older children are also clean. Of course we are talking electronics: Keyboards, TV remote, and video game controllers are great things to keep in mind.</p>
<p>If you are sick enough to miss work, you will probably spend a good time of your “time-off” stuck in bed. You need to make sure your sheets and pillow are clean and disinfected after your get better. You want eliminate the source of the illness altogether; you probably don&#8217;t want to sleep on dirty sheets anyways. While you’re at it you might also want to flip your mattress.</p>
<p>Another benefit of maintaining a clean home is the comfortable feeling you get walking into a tidy place. If you are already feeling down, the last thing you need is to feel even sick in the space that you are in. Nobody wants to clean while under the weather, but the feeling afterwards is totally worth it.</p>
<p>Cleaning your home is not a bulletproof way to stay healthy, there are external factors that will eventually get you sick. Cleaning will make sure that you are not spreading the bug around your family and hopefully will shorten the time you spend under the weather.</p>
