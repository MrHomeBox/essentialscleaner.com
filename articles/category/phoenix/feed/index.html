										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Are you Cleaning the Following?</h3>
<p>Bacteria and viruses don’t live exceptionally long on hard surfaces outside of the body. However, given the right conditions these bugs can live long enough to spread around disease. Often times the dirtiest spot in the home gets missed when house cleaning. Here are a few spots in your home that are seemingly clean but really are not.</p>
<p><strong>TV Remote:</strong><br />
What do you do when stuck sick at home? You binge catch up with all the series you are behind on. Your remote won&#8217;t look dirty but you can be sure there is a party of germs going on. A quick wipe with a sanitized towelette will stop germs from spreading around.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard/Laptop:</strong><br />
Are you the type of person that works and eats at their desk? You can imagine what that keyboard is covered with. Make sure to wipe down your keyboard every once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>Door knobs: </strong><br />
Call it a flaw in its design if you want, but door knobs are touched by everybody and therefor gross. Door knobs at home are not much different from the one at the office. Clean them up to avoid the spread of unwanted viruses like Flu causing Influenza.</p>
<p><strong>Toilet Handle:</strong><br />
It just makes sense. Not to get graphic, but if you think about it, nobody washes their hands before flushing the toilet. You may focus all the cleaning efforts into the bowl, but don’t forget to clean and disinfect the handles too.</p>
<p><strong>Refrigerator Handle:</strong><br />
Your refrigerator is magnet for bacteria, think of all the food particles you leave all over its surface while cooking and eating. You probably worry about cleaning the inside of your refrigerator, next time spend some extra time on the outside of your refrigerator</p>
