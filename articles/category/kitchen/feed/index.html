	<div class="wpb_wrapper">
		<p>VINEGAR</p>
<p>Vinegar is by far one of the most versatile cleaning agents. Use it to remove soap scum from the shower. Mix it with borax to get rid of hard-water rings in the toilet. Tape a bag of vinegar to your shower head and leave it overnight for an easy, sparkly clean; or add a couple of tablespoons of white vinegar to your dish soap to eliminate grease in the kitchen.</p>
<p>HYDROGEN PEROXIDE</p>
<p>You use your toothbrush to clean your teeth, but don’t forget about cleaning your toothbrush. Let it soak in hydrogen peroxide for a few minutes to get rid of any lingering germs. Hydrogen peroxide is also useful on many hard surfaces. Use it to scrub your toilet, trash cans, shower, mirrors and doorknob. You can even mix it with equal parts water for a safe and effective solution for mopping the bathroom and kitchen floors.</p>
<p>LEMONS</p>
<p>The acid in lemons makes them a great natural cleanser. The juice is great for disinfecting kitchen countertops and cutting boards. Cut a lemon in half and scrub your bath and shower to remove soap scum. And if your shaving cream has left a rusty ring in your bathtub, use your lemon half to scrub it away.</p>
<p>VODKA</p>
<p>Do you have a mold and mildew problem in the bathroom? Skip a trip to the store, and pull out some inexpensive vodka from the liquor cabinet. Spray it directly onto the mold and mildew, and wait 15 minutes. Then use a cloth or small scrubbing brush to wipe it clean. And don’t forget to save a little for an after-cleaning celebration!</p>
<p>TEA</p>
<p>More than a favorite beverage, brewed tea can be used to clean windows, mirrors and countertops. Spray on your bathroom surfaces just as you would any typical window or surface cleaner. Then, keep your bags to hide in the back of the fridge. They will actually work to deodorize it. And if you need to remove the scent of onion, garlic or fish from your hands, cut a bag open, and wash your hands with the leaves to remove the odor.</p>
<p>SALT</p>
<p>Remember that miracle lemon that cleaned the tub? If your dirt stains are particularly stubborn, add some salt to the lemon, and scrub the surface of your bathtub, sink or toilet. Once your salt solution has done the trick, just rinse off any pulp and leftover residue, leaving your bathroom perfectly clean with a lemon-fresh scent!</p>
<p>BAKING SODA</p>
<p>Perfect for cleaning counters, sinks, drains, the toilet bowl, soap scum, shower doors, shower heads, and well, pretty much anything in the kitchen and bathroom, baking soda is one cleaning agent you don’t want to be without. For most kitchen and bathroom surfaces, a simple paste made of baking soda and water will do the trick.</p>
<p>DRAIN CLEANER</p>
<p>Though it is not a natural cleaning solution, exactly, a drain snake is an eco-friendly way to clean out the main source of drain blockage: hair. And if you don’t have a drain snake, you can still avoid pouring harsh chemicals down the bathtub drain by unwinding a wire hanger, hooking the end, pushing it down the drain as far as it will go, and pulling up hair that is keeping the water from draining properly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tile flooring is easy to clean but definitely needs to be done daily. No one likes walking barefoot into a kitchen and feeling of the sticky or crumby tile beneath their feet, wishing they had put on socks. You have to stay on top of it! Here some basic cleaning suggestions, deep cleaning methods as well as a list of how to get rid of the build up in the grout to make your life easier.</p>
<p>Basic Care<br />
-Vacuum or sweep daily<br />
-Clean tile with a mild detergent and warm water, using a rag or chamois-type mop, rather than a sponge mop<br />
-Exchange the water frequently throughout the process; this will increase the shine and glossy look of your floors<br />
-For everyday simple clean up you may use a clean damp dust cloth<br />
-Make sure to dry the floor with a dry mop whenever you use water wile cleaning; this will help prevent future dirt from building up</p>
<p>Deep Clean<br />
-Mop the floor using a gallon of warm water and ½ cup of vinegar<br />
-Rinse the floor with clean warm water afterwards<br />
-Dry using a dry mop</p>
<p>Ways to get rid of Grout<br />
-Use a #2 pencil eraser to remove dirt in small sections<br />
-Use baking soda and water to make a paste, and then scrub with a toothbrush<br />
-If either of these don’t do the trick, using bleach is always an option. Mix beach and water at a 1:3 ratio, then e a toothbrush or sponge to scrub<br />
-After the stains are removed, wait until the grout is dry and then use a grout sealer to finish it off</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Deep Cleaning Your Kitchen</p>
<p>The kitchen is the most important place to deep clean.  You wash dishes and wipe down counters daily but the rest of it might get put on the back burner, literally. Here is how you can make sure not to miss a thing.</p>
<p>Daily Dos:<br />
First, you have to take care of the daily jobs, and then you can get to the deep clean.<br />
Wash the dishes in the sink, wipe off the counters off and unload the dishwasher.</p>
<p>Oven-on:<br />
Now the fun begins! To start, turn on your self-cleaning oven. Make sure to check it when you are done and get rid of the excess ashes of food debris at the bottom. No one needs those.</p>
<p>Organize:<br />
Take everything out of each cupboard. Place all items on the counter and wipe out each shelf. Now you can start to decide what to keep and what to get rid of. Make piles of trash and donation, then place the rest of the items neatly back inside the cupboards.<br />
Now lets hit the drawers. We all have those junk drawers we are procrastinating. Get rid of anything you are not using and de-clutter! Make sure to wipe them out before placing any items back into them.<br />
Then, it is time to tackle the fridge and freezer. Throw away anything that is freezer burnt or questionable. Wipe down all surfaces and wash drawers in the sink that are removable. Dry all surfaces and place items back inside the fridge/freezer.<br />
Tip: to get rid of sticky food left behind mix vinegar with dish soap and wipe clean</p>
<p>Under the Sink:<br />
Make sure everything is labeled. Refill any products that are running low. Wipe out area and let it dry completely before placing products back. Run your garbage disposal with half a lemon and hot water. It will give your kitchen a fresh smell.</p>
<p>Almost done:<br />
Turn off your oven and sweep up any mess you made with the ashes. Then mop! Makes sure to pay special attention to corner and baseboards. Also, pull out any appliances that can be moved in order to get underneath.</p>
<p>This sounds like a lengthy process and it is! Try listening to some music to pass the time, or just give us a call!</p>
