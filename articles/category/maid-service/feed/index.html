										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that the dirtiest places in your house are probably also the most unassuming? Even though it’s not exactly something you think about, your home is filled with hidden germs and bacteria. These surfaces can be breeding grounds for all kinds of nasty stuff, which is why it’s important to clean them regularly to avoid getting sick. If you’re anything like me, then you might cringe a little bit when thinking about cleaning your house. Perhaps images of bending awkwardly over laundry baskets or scrubbing grimy bathroom tiles come to mind&#8230; But don’t worry! Cleaning doesn’t have to be a nightmare. In fact, once you know where germs lurk and how they thrive, keeping things tidy becomes second nature.</p>
<h2>Kitchen sink</h2>
<p>Your kitchen sink is a breeding ground for bacteria, especially if you forgot to clean it after chopping raw meat on it. The best way to clean your kitchen sink is to use antibacterial spray and hot soapy water. Make sure to scrub the corners and other hard-to-reach areas. You should also clean the faucet regularly. Bacteria can build up under the faucet, which can then drip back into the sink and contaminate your food. If you want to clean the sink quickly and efficiently, use a sponge or scrubber that has disinfectant built in. And if you have children or pets, use kid-friendly cleaners and be sure to clean underneath the sink regularly.</p>
<h2>Bathroom sinks</h2>
<p>Just like kitchen sinks, bathroom sinks are breeding grounds for bacteria and germs. You should clean them regularly using antibacterial cleanser. In addition to cleaning the surface, you should also check for cracks and holes. If you find any, you should seal them with silicone. To avoid clogging the drain, you should clean the sink regularly. You should also clean the walls and back of the toilet regularly as these are two of the dirtiest areas in the bathroom. You can vacuum them or use a disinfectant cleaning spray.</p>
<h2>Shower and tub</h2>
<p>Shower walls and tubs are perfect places for bacteria to thrive. Make sure to clean them regularly to avoid getting sick. You can use a scrub brush or a cleaning sponge to clean the walls and floor of the shower and tub. Make sure to use gloves while cleaning the walls and floors to avoid germs getting into your hands. You can also use disinfectant spray to clean your shower. You can also use a squeegee to clean the walls and the floor of your tub after each use.</p>
<h2>Toilet bowl</h2>
<p>The toilet bowl is one of the dirtiest places in your house. You can disinfect it using bleach and water. To do so, mix a few drops of bleach with water and pour the mixture into the toilet bowl. Let it sit for 30 minutes and then flush the toilet. You can also use disinfectant wipes to clean the toilet bowl. To clean grout between tiles, use bleach and water.</p>
<h2>Floor tiles</h2>
<p>Carpeted areas are not the only places in your home that bacteria can thrive. Floor tiles are also ideal for bacteria to grow, especially in humid environments, such as bathrooms and kitchens. Taking care of and cleaning your tile flooring doesn&#8217;t have to be a huge chore.  Wants some tips on tile floor cleaning?  Read more in our &#8220;<a href="https://www.essentialscleaner.com/articles/how-to-clean-tile-flooring/">How to Clean Tile Flooring</a>&#8221; article.</p>

<h2>Drying rack for your laundry</h2>
<p>Your laundry drying rack is a great place for bacteria to thrive. You should make sure to clean it regularly. You can use bleach to clean it. You can also use disinfectant wipes to clean the drying rack.</p>
