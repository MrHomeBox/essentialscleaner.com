										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tile flooring is easy to clean but definitely needs to be done daily. No one likes walking barefoot into a kitchen and feeling of the sticky or crumby tile beneath their feet, wishing they had put on socks. You have to stay on top of it! Here some basic cleaning suggestions, deep cleaning methods as well as a list of how to get rid of the build up in the grout to make your life easier.</p>
<p>Basic Care<br />
-Vacuum or sweep daily<br />
-Clean tile with a mild detergent and warm water, using a rag or chamois-type mop, rather than a sponge mop<br />
-Exchange the water frequently throughout the process; this will increase the shine and glossy look of your floors<br />
-For everyday simple clean up you may use a clean damp dust cloth<br />
-Make sure to dry the floor with a dry mop whenever you use water wile cleaning; this will help prevent future dirt from building up</p>
<p>Deep Clean<br />
-Mop the floor using a gallon of warm water and ½ cup of vinegar<br />
-Rinse the floor with clean warm water afterwards<br />
-Dry using a dry mop</p>
<p>Ways to get rid of Grout<br />
-Use a #2 pencil eraser to remove dirt in small sections<br />
-Use baking soda and water to make a paste, and then scrub with a toothbrush<br />
-If either of these don’t do the trick, using bleach is always an option. Mix beach and water at a 1:3 ratio, then e a toothbrush or sponge to scrub<br />
-After the stains are removed, wait until the grout is dry and then use a grout sealer to finish it off</p>
