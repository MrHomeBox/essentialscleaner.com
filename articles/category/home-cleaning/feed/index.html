										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>House cleaning and home maintenance are time-consuming tasks that most people dislike. It’s easy to put this off and procrastinate, but in the long run, it can lead to a lot of problems and dirtier homes. Homeowners in today’s world are busy with work, kids or other commitments. It is not always feasible for everyone to find the time for daily upkeep of their house or apartment. This is why hiring a house cleaning company is a viable option for many people.</p>
<h2>Finding a Good Company</h2>
<p>When you start the process of hiring a house cleaning company, you will want to make sure you find a reputable company. How do you go about finding a trustworthy house cleaning service? Ask around. Does anyone you know use a house cleaning service? You can ask them for recommendations and read reviews online. Make sure the company uses environmentally friendly products. You don’t want harsh chemicals around your family or pets. Find out what types of customers the company usually serves. If you are hiring a house cleaning service with a special focus, such as an eco-friendly cleaning service, you want to make sure they follow through with that.</p>
<h2>How Often Should You Hire a House Cleaning Service?</h2>
<p>House cleaning should be done regularly and at least once a month. If you have kids or have frequent visitors, you might want to schedule more frequent cleanings. If you have a large house or an office, you can hire a cleaning service once every two months. However, cleaning your house regularly will save you a lot of time and money in the long run. You can also look at hiring a house cleaning company for other special occasions, too, like before you host a big party or do an outdoor barbecue, or when you’re going on vacation so you can come home to a freshly cleaned house. You can hire a house cleaning company for these events, too, but keep in mind that you may have to pay a premium for their services since they will probably be busier than usual.</p>
<h2>What to Look For in a Good House Cleaning Company</h2>
<p>There are many things to consider when hiring a house cleaning company. The cost of the service is a major factor, of course. You will also want to look at their reputation and customer satisfaction. Make sure they have workers that are properly trained and certified. In addition, you will also want to make sure they have a history of providing excellent service. What is the turnaround time for the company? How does their cleaning process work? You will want a company that can get your cleaning done quickly and efficiently so you don’t have to wait a long time for house cleaning appointments.</p>
<h2>Pros of Hiring a House Cleaning Company</h2>
<ul>
<li>You don’t have to bother with cleaning supplies or what products to use.</li>
<li>You don’t have to bother with finding a reliable cleaning crew.</li>
<li>You can hire a company that specializes in a certain type of cleaning.</li>
<li>You can hire a company that cleans your house when you don’t have the time.</li>
<li>You can schedule regular cleanings so you don’t have to worry about cleaning your house regularly.</li>
<li>You can have a clean house without having to put in a lot of effort.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons of Hiring a House Cleaning Company</h2>
<ul>
<li>You have to pay a cleaning company a fee.</li>
<li>You may have to wait for the cleaning crew to show up.</li>
<li>You may have to deal with scheduling conflicts if you have a regular cleaning service come to your house.</li>
<li>The cleaning company may miss something or not clean thoroughly in certain areas.</li>
<li>You may not get the same level of cleanliness if you clean your house yourself. In the end, hiring a house cleaning service is a personal decision that rests on a few factors. If you are having trouble finding the time for cleaning or keeping up with the messes around your house, you may want to hire a house cleaning company.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It’s easy to put off hiring a house cleaning company because you don’t want to spend the money. However, it is better to spend a little money now so you don’t have to put in a lot of effort later on. Plus, hiring a cleaning crew means you can spend your time on other more important things. If you have a busy schedule and don’t have the time to keep your house clean, hiring a house cleaning company is a great option.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who wants to spend all their time cleaning? Sadly, no one. That’s why people love tile floors. A quick wipe with a mop or a bucket of soapy water is usually enough to keep them looking clean and tidy. But if your tile floor ever gets really grimy, there are some specific things you need to know in order to make it look its best again. This guide is filled with expert advice on the ins and outs of cleaning and maintaining tile floors, including tips on how not to damage the surface when mopping it, the best way to tackle stubborn stains, what products are safe for use on tile floors, and much more&#8230;</p>
<h2>What You Should Know About Cleaning Tile Floors</h2>
<p>A tile floor is made up of individual tiles that are usually made from ceramic, porcelain, stone, or slate. Depending on the type of tiles you have, you may need to take some special precautions when cleaning them to make sure they stay in good condition. Before you start cleaning your tile floor, you need to know what type of tile it is. If you don’t know what type of tile you have, you can find out by removing one of the tiles and checking the underside. Look for markings that indicate the tile’s name and type. Before you start cleaning your tile floor, you also need to know what kind of grout you have. Grout is the substance that fills the cracks between tiles. Most types of grout are porous and can stain easily.</p>
<h2>How to Vacuum a Tile Floor</h2>
<p>If you want a quick, easy clean on your tile floor, a vacuum cleaner is the perfect tool for the job. But you do have to be careful. There are a few things you need to know about how to vacuum a tile floor. &#8211; First of all, avoid using a rotating brush on your vacuum cleaner when cleaning your tile floor. Grout is porous and can be easily damaged and stained by bristles that are too strong. &#8211; If your vacuum cleaner has suction controls, make sure that you turn it down to the lowest setting possible when cleaning your tile floor. &#8211; Make sure to use a wide head on your vacuum cleaner nozzle. You want to make sure that you are covering as much of the floor as possible with each sweep of the nozzle. &#8211; Make sure that you vacuum your tile floor as soon as it’s dirty. Wet grout is much more likely to stain than dry grout.</p>
<h2>How to Mop a Tile Floor</h2>
<p>If you have a relatively clean tile floor, a good water-based mop and some plain water will be enough to keep your tile floor clean and looking great. If you have a relatively clean tile floor, a good water-based mop and some plain water will be enough to keep it clean and looking great. But if you have a really dirty tile floor, you may need to use something stronger to tackle tough stains. If you have a really dirty tile floor, you may need to use something stronger to tackle tough stains. But be careful when choosing a cleaner for your tile floor. Some common products, such as bleach and vinegar, can stain tile floors and grout lines. There are special tile floor cleaning products that are made to be safe for use on a tile floor, such as Bissell Little Green Professional. The best way to mop a tile floor is to start at the outside edge of the room and work your way in.</p>
<h2>How to Mop a Ceramic Tile Floor</h2>
<p>Ceramic tile floors are usually relatively easy to clean, but you may still have to do a little more than just mopping with water in some cases. If your ceramic tile floor is really dirty, you may need to use a stronger cleaner with enzymes to break down tough stains and odors. You may also want to use a scrub to help remove built-up dirt and grime. Choosing a mop for your ceramic tile floor is important. It’s best to avoid using a sponge mop on ceramic floors, as sponges can easily scratch the floor and leave it dull. Instead, choose a mop with a soft, microfiber head. This will be gentle on the floor while still being effective at cleaning it.</p>
<h2>How to Mop a Marble Tile Floor</h2>
<p>Maintaining a marble tile floor is similar to maintaining a ceramic tile floor. You want to avoid spilling or spraying water directly on the surface of your marble tile floor. This can cause water stains on the tile surface. A microfiber mop is the best choice for cleaning a marble tile floor. A sponge mop can scratch the surface and cause it to look dull and worn. Avoid using strong chemical cleaners on your marble tile floor. Some common household cleaners can etch the surface, causing permanent damage to the tile.</p>
<h2>How to Bleach a Tile Floor</h2>
<p>If you have a really stubborn stain on your tile floor, you may want to consider bleaching it. You want to be careful when bleaching a tile floor, though. If you use too much bleach, or if you leave it on the floor for too long, you can damage your tile floor. The best way to bleach a tile floor is to dilute the bleach with water in a spray bottle and then spray it on the tile floor. Let it sit for two or three minutes, and then scrub it off with a sponge or scrub brush. If you have a particularly tough stain, you may want to alternate between using the diluted bleach solution and a mild cleaning solution. This will help prevent the bleach from etching the tile surface.</p>
<h2>How to Mop and Bleach a Grout Line</h2>
<p>If your tile floor has a grout line, you may have noticed that it’s a bit harder to clean than the tile itself. The grout can get really dirty, especially in high-traffic areas like kitchens and entryways. The best way to clean the grout in a tile floor is to use a grout cleaning product. There are lots of different products you can use to clean grout. You may want to try a few different products to see which one works best for you. Be careful when cleaning grout, though. You want to avoid scrubbing too hard when cleaning the grout. If you scrub too hard, you can scratch the surface of the tile and cause it to look dull and worn.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>A tile floor is a beautiful addition to any home, but it can be hard to keep clean. Luckily, most tile floors are fairly easy to clean when you know what you’re doing. If your tile floor is really dirty, it’s best to scrub with a cleaning product that’s designed for tile floors to avoid scratching the surface. And make sure to always use a soft scrubber to prevent scratching. When all is said and done, a tile floor really is a beautiful thing.</p>

		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever noticed your grout goes from white to grey? Yup, dirt builds up here and one day it’s not going to look so new anymore! It can be pretty expensive to hire a vendor who specializes in grout cleaning so if you are cost conscientious and are in for a chore that can double as a workout you can do it yourself. Now that’s self-gratification!   </span></p>
<h2>Steps for Grout Cleaning</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few different ways you can get the job done:</span></p>
<h3 class="p2">Baking Soda &amp; Water</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mix 3 parts of baking soda to 1 part water to make a thick paste. This cleaner is versatile and works with all colors of grout (this isn’t the best option for natural stones like marble or travertine). </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easiest to use your fingers to apply the paste between the grout lines, that way you can reach every nook and cranny.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rubber gloves aren’t a necessity but can help prevent scratches protect your skin from irritation.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Vinegar &amp; Water</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Couple the paste from the baking soda with vinegar and water in a spray bottle. You can spray the grout lines without getting hands-on. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Pause for the bubbles! The combination of baking soda and vinegar causes the mixture to bubble and is a sign that the solution is working. Once it simmers down after a couple of minutes it’s time for you to wipe the surface clean.</li>
<li>Use a nylon-bristled brush. If you use steel or wire bristled brushes they may damage the grout.</li>
<li>Mop and rinse. The last step would mean to mop the floor with plain water to pick up any leftover residue and you’re done!</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><b>Oxygenated Bleach</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Let 2 tablespoons of oxygenated bleach dissolve into 2 cups of warm water.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> You’ll want to make sure that you are ready to use the mixture as soon as it’s made for the best results. Bleaching is gentle enough for different types of tile but this isn’t best for colored grout. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test it first! Use some of the solution on a small corner of the floor to make sure there is no discoloration by the bleach and then you’re clear to go!</span></li>
<li>Clean one section at a time. This will ensure that the solution is used evenly and you’ll be less likely to have a totally wet floor! Pour just enough for each room so all grout lines are reached.</li>
<li>AGAIN &#8211; Nylon bristled brushes! Don’t forget the corners!!</li>
<li>For more stubborn stained grout lines, dip your brush in the solution itself before scrubbing for maximum potency.</li>
<li>Lastly, rinse with plain water and let that floor shine!</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Time for the big guns! Rent or buy a steam cleaner!</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steam cleaners can effectively clean and sanitize all types of tiles and grouts and a big plus for many, without any chemicals. You can usually find them in a home improvement store. Just make sure that the steam cleaner you acquire has a steam hose and brush attachment regardless if you’re renting or buying the unit.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you turn the steam cleaner on, you’ll want to move the brush back and forth over the grout. The most effective way to go about this is to start from the back of the floor to the front. Watch as the steam loosens up that dirt and reveal a floor that’s like-new! Another benefit of steam is killing any mildew that could be growing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No need to mop, just a simple wipe as the steam will have already blanketed the floor with moisture. And voila! Chemical-free cleanliness. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><b>CAUTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Grout sealant can be wiped away from steam cleaning so it’s best if the grout hasn’t been sealed already or if it’s something you’re going to replace in the near future. </span></p>

		<p>Cleaning a fireplace is usually one of those items that is overlooked, even in a deep home cleaning. It is important to regularly clean the fireplace as the leftover build up from fires can become toxic and can potentially harm your family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Cleaning the inside of a Fireplace</h2>
<p><strong>Wait at least 24 hours since the last time the fireplace has been used.</strong></p>
<h3>Supplies Needed:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plastic tarp</li>
<li>Old Towels or Sheets</li>
<li>Apron</li>
<li>Handheld Broom and Dust Pan</li>
<li>Vacuum</li>
<li>Trash Bags</li>
</ul>
<h3>STEP 1:  Prepare the Area</h3>
<p>Lay a plastic tarp around and in front of the fireplace area. If you do not have a plastic tarp, old towels will do. Also, make sure to wear an apron and protective gloves. You may also want to wear old clothes as soot and dirt can be difficult to get off. If you have furniture close by it may also be a good idea to place sheets or towels over the surfaces to protect it.</p>
<h3>STEP 2: Remove debris</h3>
<p>First take out any metal grates that may be in the fireplace. Next, take any wood, tinder, or debris from the fireplace. We suggest wearing protective gloves to do this. Using a handheld broom sweep any dirt, debris or soot up and place it in a waste bin.</p>
<h3>STEP 3: Get the small bits!</h3>
<p>If necessary use a vacuum to pick up any remaining ash. Then throw away the debris into an outside bin.</p>
<h2>Spot Clean the Brick on a Fireplace</h2>
<h3>Supplies Needed:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cream of Tartar</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Old Tooth Brush</li>
<li>Rag</li>
</ul>
<h3>STEP 1: Make your mixture</h3>
<p>Mix two tablespoons of cream of tartar with a little water to make a paste.</p>
<h3>STEP 2:  Apply</h3>
<p>Spread the paste on the brick with an old toothbrush. Then wait for ten minutes to let the paste sit.</p>
<h3>STEP 3: Wash</h3>
<p>After ten minutes use warm water and a rag to wash off the paste. If necessary apply more past and repeat steps.</p>
<h2>Detailed Cleaning of Larger Brick Areas</h2>
<h3>Supplies Needed:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Baking Soda</li>
<li>Dish Soap</li>
<li>Tooth brush and/or larger scrub brush</li>
<li>Dish Cloth</li>
</ul>
<h3>STEP 1: Make your paste</h3>
<p>Make a thin paste that is easy to spread by mixing 3 tablespoons dish soap with a half cup of baking soda. You can add more dish soap if the paste is too thick.</p>
<h3>STEP 2: Dip and Scrub</h3>
<p>Dip the scrub brush into the paste you have just made. Make circular motions on the brick surfaces inside and/or outside of the fireplace. When all brick surfaces of the fireplace are covered, let sit for five minutes.</p>
<h3>STEP 3: Rinse!</h3>
<p>After the paste has sat for five minutes, rinse the paste off with a cloth and warm water.</p>
<h3>STEP 4: Repeat</h3>
<p>Repeat from step one as needed.</p>
<h2>Cleaning Fireplace Glass</h2>
<h3>Supplies Needed:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stove Glass cleaner</li>
<li>Soft Dish Clothes (3 or more)</li>
<li>Water</li>
</ul>
<h3>STEP 1: Check before you start</h3>
<p>Be sure the glass has already cooled and that the inside of the fireplace has been vacuumed and cleaned out.</p>
<h3>STEP 2: Spray</h3>
<p>Get one of the clothes damp with warm water. Spray some of the stove glass cleaner onto the damp cloth.</p>
<h3>STEP 3</h3>
<p>Next rub the cloth over the fireplace glass focusing on the stained areas. Once again, use circular motions as well as back and forth motions. You may need to apply some pressure to get hard stains to come off.</p>
<h3>STEP 4</h3>
<p>Continue to apply more cleaner to the cloth and continue circular and back to forth motions until all stains have been removed.</p>
<h3>STEP 5</h3>
<p>After all stains have been removed take a new damp cloth and wipe the surfaces clean.</p>
<h3>STEP 6</h3>
<p>Lastly, take your last clean cloth and dry the glass so that there are no streaks.</p>
<p>That’s it!</p>

		<p>Cleaning ann oven usually involves harsh chemicals that create fumes and an unsafe environment for your family. We detailed a safe way to clean your oven with everyday products you likely have already in your home. All you need is a few items and a little elbow grease! I will list two options depending on the type of oven you have in your home.</p>
<h2>How to Clean a Self-Cleaning Oven</h2>
<p><strong>SUPPLIES NEEDED:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Dish Soap</li>
<li>Sponge</li>
<li>Vinegar</li>
<li>Small Brush and Dust Pan</li>
<li>2 or 3 Gentle Clothes</li>
</ul>
<p>STEP 1</p>
<p>Choose a time when the kitchen is not being used. Open windows and possibly doors to ventilate the room so that fumes do not bother family members. Make sure you will be home for the length of the self-clean. (The average self-clean cycle can last 3 to 6 hours)</p>
<p>STEP 2</p>
<p>Remove the oven racks and any other objects you have inside the oven. Set them aside. Place oven racks in the sink with warm water and a few drops of dish soap to soak. Vinegar and hot water can also be used as a soaking solution.</p>
<p>STEP 3</p>
<p>Turn on the oven’s self-cleaning mode. The oven door should then lock. If the oven door does not lock, place tape over the door or use another barrier to make sure that family members will not be able to open the door. During a cleaning cycle the oven will reach between 800 and 900 degrees Fahrenheit. The cycle will turn any food and grease into gray ash.</p>
<p>STEP 4</p>
<p>Wait at least two hours after the oven’s self-cleaning cycle has finished in order to let the oven cool down. Once it has cooled completely, sweep any ash out of the oven with a small brush and dustpan. Next use a damp cloth to wipe the oven clean. You can use a vinegar and water solution to dampen the cloth.</p>
<p>If the oven is extra dirty you may need to continue reading and scrub the oven with the solutions below under “Non-Self Cleaning Oven”. If the oven is now clean, continue.</p>
<p>STEP 5</p>
<p>After you have let the oven racks soak, scrub any extra food or grease off of each rack with a sponge. Rinse the racks and dry them with a clean towel. Then place them back inside the oven.</p>
<p>STEP 6</p>
<p>Clean the seals of the oven as well as the exterior oven door with a gentle cloth and hydrogen peroxide. This can also be done periodically to keep the door clean. And that’s it!</p>
<h2>How to Clean a Non-Self-Cleaning Oven</h2>
<p><strong>SUPPLIES NEEDED:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Baking soda</li>
<li>Rubber gloves</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Rubber gloves</li>
<li>Damp dishcloth</li>
<li>Plastic or silicone spatula</li>
<li>Spray bottle</li>
<li>White vinegar</li>
</ul>
<p>STEP 1</p>
<p>Remove the oven racks and any other objects you have inside the oven. Set them aside. Place oven racks in the sink with warm water and a few drops of dish soap to soak. Vinegar and hot water can also be used as a soaking solution.</p>
<p>STEP 2</p>
<p>Remove the oven racks and any other objects you have inside the oven. Set them aside. Place oven racks in the sink with warm water and a few drops of dish soap to soak. Vinegar and hot water can also be used as a soaking solution.</p>
<p>STEP 3</p>
<p>Make a baking soda paste. Mix ½ cup of baking soda with a few tablespoons of water in a bowl. Usually, 3 or 4 tablespoons of water make a great spreadable paste.</p>
<p>STEP 4</p>
<p>Use a sponge to spread the baking soda paste over the interior surfaces of your oven. Make sure to be aware of heating elements. This would be a great time to put on those rubber gloves in case your oven is full of grease and grime. The baking soda paste may turn a brownish color which is perfectly okay. Make sure to get all the nooks and crannies.</p>
<p>STEP 5</p>
<p>Let the paste sit in the oven overnight or approximately 12 hours.</p>
<p>STEP 6</p>
<p>Use a damp gentle cloth and wipe out the oven. You may need to use a plastic or silicone spatula with a little bit of elbow grease for those hard area.</p>
<p>STEP 7</p>
<p>Now fill a spray bottle with vinegar and spray the areas you still see baking soda. This will create a reaction and the baking soda will foam, making it easier to remove.</p>
<p>STEP 8</p>
<p>Do a final wipe down, removing the last bit of foam and solution from your oven. Use a clean damp cloth and possibly more vinegar to make the surfaces shiny.</p>
<p>STEP 9</p>
<p>Place the clean oven racks back inside the oven.</p>
<p>That’s it!!!</p>

<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
	<div class="wpb_wrapper">
		<p>VINEGAR</p>
<p>Vinegar is by far one of the most versatile cleaning agents. Use it to remove soap scum from the shower. Mix it with borax to get rid of hard-water rings in the toilet. Tape a bag of vinegar to your shower head and leave it overnight for an easy, sparkly clean; or add a couple of tablespoons of white vinegar to your dish soap to eliminate grease in the kitchen.</p>
<p>HYDROGEN PEROXIDE</p>
<p>You use your toothbrush to clean your teeth, but don’t forget about cleaning your toothbrush. Let it soak in hydrogen peroxide for a few minutes to get rid of any lingering germs. Hydrogen peroxide is also useful on many hard surfaces. Use it to scrub your toilet, trash cans, shower, mirrors and doorknob. You can even mix it with equal parts water for a safe and effective solution for mopping the bathroom and kitchen floors.</p>
<p>LEMONS</p>
<p>The acid in lemons makes them a great natural cleanser. The juice is great for disinfecting kitchen countertops and cutting boards. Cut a lemon in half and scrub your bath and shower to remove soap scum. And if your shaving cream has left a rusty ring in your bathtub, use your lemon half to scrub it away.</p>
<p>VODKA</p>
<p>Do you have a mold and mildew problem in the bathroom? Skip a trip to the store, and pull out some inexpensive vodka from the liquor cabinet. Spray it directly onto the mold and mildew, and wait 15 minutes. Then use a cloth or small scrubbing brush to wipe it clean. And don’t forget to save a little for an after-cleaning celebration!</p>
<p>TEA</p>
<p>More than a favorite beverage, brewed tea can be used to clean windows, mirrors and countertops. Spray on your bathroom surfaces just as you would any typical window or surface cleaner. Then, keep your bags to hide in the back of the fridge. They will actually work to deodorize it. And if you need to remove the scent of onion, garlic or fish from your hands, cut a bag open, and wash your hands with the leaves to remove the odor.</p>
<p>SALT</p>
<p>Remember that miracle lemon that cleaned the tub? If your dirt stains are particularly stubborn, add some salt to the lemon, and scrub the surface of your bathtub, sink or toilet. Once your salt solution has done the trick, just rinse off any pulp and leftover residue, leaving your bathroom perfectly clean with a lemon-fresh scent!</p>
<p>BAKING SODA</p>
<p>Perfect for cleaning counters, sinks, drains, the toilet bowl, soap scum, shower doors, shower heads, and well, pretty much anything in the kitchen and bathroom, baking soda is one cleaning agent you don’t want to be without. For most kitchen and bathroom surfaces, a simple paste made of baking soda and water will do the trick.</p>
<p>DRAIN CLEANER</p>
<p>Though it is not a natural cleaning solution, exactly, a drain snake is an eco-friendly way to clean out the main source of drain blockage: hair. And if you don’t have a drain snake, you can still avoid pouring harsh chemicals down the bathtub drain by unwinding a wire hanger, hooking the end, pushing it down the drain as far as it will go, and pulling up hair that is keeping the water from draining properly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Are you Cleaning the Following?</h3>
<p>Bacteria and viruses don’t live exceptionally long on hard surfaces outside of the body. However, given the right conditions these bugs can live long enough to spread around disease. Often times the dirtiest spot in the home gets missed when house cleaning. Here are a few spots in your home that are seemingly clean but really are not.</p>
<p><strong>TV Remote:</strong><br />
What do you do when stuck sick at home? You binge catch up with all the series you are behind on. Your remote won&#8217;t look dirty but you can be sure there is a party of germs going on. A quick wipe with a sanitized towelette will stop germs from spreading around.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard/Laptop:</strong><br />
Are you the type of person that works and eats at their desk? You can imagine what that keyboard is covered with. Make sure to wipe down your keyboard every once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>Door knobs: </strong><br />
Call it a flaw in its design if you want, but door knobs are touched by everybody and therefor gross. Door knobs at home are not much different from the one at the office. Clean them up to avoid the spread of unwanted viruses like Flu causing Influenza.</p>
<p><strong>Toilet Handle:</strong><br />
It just makes sense. Not to get graphic, but if you think about it, nobody washes their hands before flushing the toilet. You may focus all the cleaning efforts into the bowl, but don’t forget to clean and disinfect the handles too.</p>
<p><strong>Refrigerator Handle:</strong><br />
Your refrigerator is magnet for bacteria, think of all the food particles you leave all over its surface while cooking and eating. You probably worry about cleaning the inside of your refrigerator, next time spend some extra time on the outside of your refrigerator</p>
