										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to cleaning your bedroom, there is nothing quite like a deep clean. A deep clean of your bedroom requires more effort and time than a regular cleaning, and the results are worth it. Not only will your bedroom look and feel better, but your overall wellbeing will improve as well. With this guide, you will learn how to deep clean your bedroom, when to hire a house cleaning service, and how to maintain a clean bedroom.</p>
<h2>Introduction to a Deep Clean</h2>
<p>A deep clean is a comprehensive cleaning of your bedroom or any other area of your home. It goes beyond the basics of regular cleaning, such as dusting and vacuuming, to include more thorough tasks. A deep clean of your bedroom should include dusting and vacuuming, but it should also include cleaning the windows, washing the curtains and blinds, and cleaning the carpets.</p>
<p>It is important to note that a deep clean is not the same as a spring cleaning. While a deep clean is a thorough cleaning of your bedroom, a spring cleaning is an annual event that involves cleaning the entire home. A deep clean of your bedroom should be done at least once a month, while a spring cleaning is done once a year.</p>
<h2>Benefits of a Deep Clean</h2>
<p>The most obvious benefit of a deep clean of your bedroom is that it will make your room look and feel better. Dust and dirt can build up over time, and a deep clean can help to remove it. Additionally, a deep clean can help to reduce allergens and other irritants in your bedroom, making it a healthier environment.</p>
<p>Cleaning your bedroom can also help to reduce stress levels. A cluttered and disorganized room can be overwhelming, but a deep clean of your bedroom can help to create a sense of order. This, in turn, can help to reduce stress levels and improve your overall wellbeing.</p>
<h2>Preparing to Deep Clean Your Bedroom</h2>
<p>Before you begin a deep clean of your bedroom, it is important to take some time to prepare. This will help to ensure that the cleaning process goes smoothly and that you are able to get the most out of the deep clean.</p>
<p>The first step in preparing to deep clean your bedroom is to declutter. Remove any items that are no longer needed or used, and organize the items that are staying. This will make it easier to clean and will help to maximize the effectiveness of the deep clean.</p>
<p>Next, you should gather all of the materials and supplies you will need for the deep clean. This should include a vacuum cleaner, dusting cloths, cleaning products, and any other items that you may need.</p>
<h2>How to Deep Clean Your Bedroom</h2>
<p>Once you have prepared for the deep clean, you are ready to begin. Start by vacuuming the floors, rugs, and carpets. Pay special attention to the areas that tend to collect dust, such as under the bed and in the corners.</p>
<p>Next, dust all surfaces and furniture. Be sure to dust the ceiling fans, window sills, and any other hard-to-reach areas. Once you have finished dusting, use a damp cloth to wipe down all surfaces.</p>
<p>After that, you can move on to cleaning the windows and window coverings. Vacuum the curtains and blinds, and then use a cleaning product to wash them. For the windows, use a glass cleaner and a lint-free cloth to clean the glass and the frames.</p>
<p>Once the windows and window coverings have been cleaned, it is time to move on to the other areas of the bedroom. Vacuum the mattress and the box spring, and then use a cleaning product to spot clean any stains. Vacuum the furniture, and then use a cleaning product to spot clean any stains or spills.</p>
<p>Finally, mop the floors and vacuum the carpets. Once you have finished, your bedroom should be sparkling clean. If you have tile floors in your bedroom, check out our <a href="https://www.essentialscleaner.com/articles/cleaning-and-maintaining-tile-floors-a-step-by-step-guide/">tips for how to tackle tile floors and grout</a>.</p>
<h2>Cleaning Tips for Your Bedroom</h2>
<p>When it comes to cleaning your bedroom, there are a few tips that can help make the process easier. First, use a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter to remove dust, dirt, and other allergens from the air. This will help to reduce the number of irritants in your bedroom.</p>
<p>Second, use a damp cloth to dust surfaces instead of a dry cloth. This will help to pick up more dust and dirt, and will also help to reduce the amount of dust that is kicked up into the air.</p>
<p>Third, use a mild cleaning product to clean surfaces and furniture. Stronger cleaning products can damage the surfaces and furniture, so it is best to use a gentler product to avoid any damage.</p>
<p>Finally, use a lint-free cloth to clean windows and window coverings. This will help to prevent any streaks or smears from forming.</p>
<h2>When to Hire a House Cleaning Service</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.essentialscleaner.com/services/house-cleaning/">deep clean of your bedroom</a> is an intensive process, and it can be difficult to do it on your own. If you are unable to do a deep clean of your bedroom yourself, it may be time to consider hiring a house cleaning service.</p>
<p>House cleaning services can provide a thorough deep clean of your bedroom, and they can do it in a fraction of the time it would take you to do it yourself. Additionally, they can provide a level of cleaning that you may not be able to achieve on your own.</p>
<p>It is important to note that a deep clean of your bedroom is not the same as a regular house cleaning. A deep clean is a more intensive process, and it should be done at least once a month. A regular house cleaning is a less intensive process, and it should be done on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.</p>
<h2>How to Find a House Cleaning Service</h2>
<p>Finding a house cleaning service can be a daunting task, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be. There are a few steps you can take to ensure that you are <a href="https://essentialscleaner.com/book">hiring a reputable and reliable house cleaning service</a>.</p>
<p>First, ask for recommendations from friends, family, and neighbors. They may be able to provide you with the names of reputable house cleaning services in your area.</p>
<p>Second, research the different house cleaning services in your area. Read reviews and check out their websites to get an idea of the services they offer and the quality of their work.</p>
<p>Finally, make sure to ask questions before hiring a house cleaning service. Make sure to inquire about their rates, services, and policies. This will help to ensure that you are getting the best service for your money.

<h2>Essential Cleaning Supplies for Your Bedroom</h2>
<p>When it comes to deep cleaning your bedroom, there are a few essential cleaning supplies that you will need. These include a vacuum cleaner, dusting cloths, cleaning products, a lint-free cloth, and a mop.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.essentialscleaner.com/articles/vacuum-the-right-way/">vacuum cleaner is essential</a> for picking up dust, dirt, and other allergens from the floors and carpets. Dusting cloths are also essential for removing dust from surfaces and furniture.</p>
<p>Cleaning products are also essential for deep cleaning your bedroom. You will need a mild cleaning product for surfaces and furniture, as well as a glass cleaner for the windows.</p>
<p>Finally, a lint-free cloth and a mop are essential for cleaning the windows and the floors. The lint-free cloth will help to prevent any streaks or smears from forming on the windows, while the mop will help to make the floors sparkle.</p>
<h2>Tips for Maintaining a Clean Bedroom</h2>
<p>Once you have completed a deep clean of your bedroom, it is important to maintain it. This will help to ensure that your bedroom remains clean and organized.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to maintain a clean bedroom is to stay on top of the cleaning. This means vacuuming and dusting on a regular basis, as well as spot cleaning any spills or stains.</p>
<p>Another tip for maintaining a clean bedroom is to declutter regularly. This means getting rid of any items that are no longer needed or used. This will help to keep the bedroom organized and will make it easier to clean.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to have a cleaning schedule. This will help to ensure that you are staying on top of the cleaning and that your bedroom remains clean and organized.</p>

		<p>Thanksgiving is a special day of <a href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/explore/history/thanksgiving-traditions/#:~:text=Traditional%20foods%20are%20a%20large,the%20end%20of%20the%20meal.">celebrations and traditions</a> where family and food come together to celebrate. Even though Thanksgiving makes for great memories, the post-meal clean-up is not one of them.</p>
<p>A lot of work goes into pulling off a successful Thanksgiving. To make Thanksgiving a little bit easier we recommend following these tips to save yourself time and effort, so you can spend more time eating, relaxing, and enjoying the holiday. Also be sure to <a href="https://www.essentialscleaner.com/articles/common-house-cleaning-mistakes-you-can-avoid/">avoid common cleaning mistakes</a>, so that you don&#8217;t have to repeat your cleaning efforts!</p>
<h2>Before Thanksgiving Cleaning Tips</h2>
<p>Having a plan is the best way to cut down on your time spent cleaning up. You can save time by taking cleaning steps as you cooking.</p>
<p>Here are our top cleaning tips for cooking and cleaning on Thanksgiving:</p>
<p>Clear out the fridge.  Before the Thanksgiving holiday gets ahead of you, clear out your fridge by removing old leftovers and expired food. This will help when you are looking for fridge space to fit your Thanksgiving leftovers.</p>
<p>Empty the dishwasher. Make sure you empty your dishwasher before you start cooking, that way you can cook and load the dishwasher as you progress. All make sure to unload the dishwasher before mealtime, that way recently used dishes and be put right in the dishwasher, instead of pilling up for later.</p>
<p>Recruit helpers. Make sure your family knows they will need to help clean up right after the meal! This way the expectation is set and they are ready to help.</p>
<h2>After Thanksgiving Cleaning Tips</h2>
<p>After the big meal is when most of the house cleaning takes place, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be a long or tedious task. If you&#8217;ve followed the pre-meal tips above, these post-turkey tips will help you get the cleaning done quickly.</p>
<p>Put those recruits to work. Take your team of cleaning recruits and assign them to different tasks in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Clearing tables. Have someone in charge of clearing the table and wiping the counters down.</p>
<p>Washing dishes. While one person clears the table, have another take the incoming dishes and get them washed or loaded into the dishwasher.</p>
<p>Storing left overs. One person can be designated to condensing left overs into smaller containers. Those dishes can then be passed on to the dishwashing team member.</p>
<p>Sweeping the floors. And the final step is to have someone sweep up after all the other tasks have been completed.</p>

		<p>When people think about how they want to spend their free time, they almost never want to spend it on cleaning the house. So when it is time to get your chores and house cleaning done, make sure you do it right so that it stays cleaner longer! We’ve gathered a list of the most common home cleaning mistakes that people make.</p>
<h2>1. Too Much Polish?</h2>
<p>Spraying polish directly into the furniture ends up making things worse in the long run, as it creates a build-up that is hard to remove and will only attract more dust. Always spray your polish in a microfiber cloth and then apply the polish.</p>
<h2>2. That Sponge is… Gross!</h2>
<p>Using dirty sponges is a worldwide problem. No, really! A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-06055-9#Sec6">study published in Scientific Reports</a> found over 362 different types of bacteria on kitchen sponges. If you do not sanitize your sponges, then you are pro-actively spreading germs in your home. An easy way to sanitize a sponge is by microwaving it.  Fill a microwaveable dish with water, soak your sponge, and then set the microwave on high for a minute or two. The microwave is an effective way of killing bacteria, zapping 99.9% of germs in a sponge.</p>
<h2>3. Smelly Rags</h2>
<p>Using the same rag around the house. Same idea with the sponge if you don’t clean the rag, despite you spritzing it with a cleaning solution, it will only spread the germs from one surface to another. To avoid this, designate a microfiber for each part of the home that needs to be wiped.</p>
<h2>4. Lighter Than a Feather!</h2>
<p>Using a feather duster is okay, right? A feather duster can be useful, in some cases.  But as a method for removing dust from your home, it does a better job of spreading dust around your home. Limit using a feather duster to getting into small cracks. Do not use a feather duster on the majority of the surfaces in your home, as it does not attract and hold that dust, but just pushes it to other places in your home. Instead, use a duster that has a static &#8220;stick&#8221; that holds onto the dust or a damp microfiber cloth.</p>
<h2>5. Let the Light Shine!</h2>
<p>Cleaning windows on a sunny day can lead to problems if it is also hot out! The heat from the sun will dry your window cleaning product faster than you can actually clean, which will leave streaks. A cloudy day is your best bet when cleaning your windows.</p>
<h2>6. Spill or Stains on Carpet</h2>
<p>Immediately scrubbing carpet spills is probably our reflex when we drop coffee or Bolognese sauce on the carpet but do not rush to do that as it may twist the fibers on your carpet.  Blot the spill first with a paper towel and then treat it with a stain remover.</p>
<h2>7. Germs in Your Cutting Board?</h2>
<p>Washing your cutting board with dish soap is not ideal as the crack on its surface can trap microscopic food particles which can then become a breeding ground for bacteria. The best way to clean a cutting board (both wood and plastic) is to soak it in hydrogen peroxide or bleach solution. Wash with water and dry completely.</p>
<h2>8. A Vacuum that Makes Things Worse.</h2>
<p>Not cleaning the vacuum is a cleaning mistake because when the filter has not been changed or cleaned its ability to pick up dust or dirt will decrease, worst, dirt can also be blown back by the dusty vent.  It is best to change or empty canisters as soon as they become full. Wipe vacuum attachments as well with a microfiber cloth.</p>
<h2>9. Crumbs, Crumbs, Crumbs.</h2>
<p>Always take out crumbs in crevices before proceeding to clean otherwise it will defeat the purpose of you cleaning it. It is also best to use a &#8220;top-down&#8221; approach when cleaning, which means you clean higher surfaces first, which allows dust, crumbs, etc., to fall down to the lower surfaces. Then you can effectively clean the lower surfaces without having to re-clean them after dust lands on them from the higher surfaces.</p>
<h2>10. You Touch That?</h2>
<p>Do you clean your tv your remote? It&#8217;s not really one of those checklist items that most people have on their cleaning list, but almost everyone in your household will touch the tv remote.  That’s why it is important to sanitize your remote at least once a week.</p>
<h2>Automate Your House Cleaning</h2>
<p>If you ever find yourself without the time to properly clean your home, you can always <a href="https://www.essentialscleaner.com/book/">get a price &amp; book online</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a DIY type of person, read our other articles to level-up your house cleaning skills. To get a head start, we recommend learning about the <a href="https://www.essentialscleaner.com/articles/6-areas-to-clean/">6 areas you might not be cleaning enough in your home</a>.</p>

		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever noticed your grout goes from white to grey? Yup, dirt builds up here and one day it’s not going to look so new anymore! It can be pretty expensive to hire a vendor who specializes in grout cleaning so if you are cost conscientious and are in for a chore that can double as a workout you can do it yourself. Now that’s self-gratification!   </span></p>
<h2>Steps for Grout Cleaning</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few different ways you can get the job done:</span></p>
<h3 class="p2">Baking Soda &amp; Water</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mix 3 parts of baking soda to 1 part water to make a thick paste. This cleaner is versatile and works with all colors of grout (this isn’t the best option for natural stones like marble or travertine). </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easiest to use your fingers to apply the paste between the grout lines, that way you can reach every nook and cranny.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rubber gloves aren’t a necessity but can help prevent scratches protect your skin from irritation.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Vinegar &amp; Water</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Couple the paste from the baking soda with vinegar and water in a spray bottle. You can spray the grout lines without getting hands-on. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Pause for the bubbles! The combination of baking soda and vinegar causes the mixture to bubble and is a sign that the solution is working. Once it simmers down after a couple of minutes it’s time for you to wipe the surface clean.</li>
<li>Use a nylon-bristled brush. If you use steel or wire bristled brushes they may damage the grout.</li>
<li>Mop and rinse. The last step would mean to mop the floor with plain water to pick up any leftover residue and you’re done!</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><b>Oxygenated Bleach</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Let 2 tablespoons of oxygenated bleach dissolve into 2 cups of warm water.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> You’ll want to make sure that you are ready to use the mixture as soon as it’s made for the best results. Bleaching is gentle enough for different types of tile but this isn’t best for colored grout. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test it first! Use some of the solution on a small corner of the floor to make sure there is no discoloration by the bleach and then you’re clear to go!</span></li>
<li>Clean one section at a time. This will ensure that the solution is used evenly and you’ll be less likely to have a totally wet floor! Pour just enough for each room so all grout lines are reached.</li>
<li>AGAIN &#8211; Nylon bristled brushes! Don’t forget the corners!!</li>
<li>For more stubborn stained grout lines, dip your brush in the solution itself before scrubbing for maximum potency.</li>
<li>Lastly, rinse with plain water and let that floor shine!</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Time for the big guns! Rent or buy a steam cleaner!</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steam cleaners can effectively clean and sanitize all types of tiles and grouts and a big plus for many, without any chemicals. You can usually find them in a home improvement store. Just make sure that the steam cleaner you acquire has a steam hose and brush attachment regardless if you’re renting or buying the unit.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you turn the steam cleaner on, you’ll want to move the brush back and forth over the grout. The most effective way to go about this is to start from the back of the floor to the front. Watch as the steam loosens up that dirt and reveal a floor that’s like-new! Another benefit of steam is killing any mildew that could be growing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No need to mop, just a simple wipe as the steam will have already blanketed the floor with moisture. And voila! Chemical-free cleanliness. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><b>CAUTION:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Grout sealant can be wiped away from steam cleaning so it’s best if the grout hasn’t been sealed already or if it’s something you’re going to replace in the near future. </span></p>

		<p>Do you think you’re ready to list your home on the market? No so fast! There’s a lot more work involved than you may initially think.</p>
<h2>Steps for Staging Your Home</h2>
<p>Here are some helpful tips to make the staging process a little easier and pain-free.</p>
<h3>Step 1 &#8211; Clean your home!</h3>
<p>This should be priority number one. You can’t just let potential buyers walk in at any moment. What quicker and easier way than to hire a professional cleaning service *hint, hint* to do it for you! Whether you are short on time or not, make your home look like a shiny new penny.</p>
<h3>Step 2 &#8211; Discard your junk!</h3>
<p>If you’ve been procrastinating on going through the boxes in the garage or donating old clothes, you have no excuse now! Regardless if your home is big or small, anything that doesn’t belong can clutter space and make the space feel cramped. Getting rid of things is more ideal but simply organizing will help an open house be just that… an open house! It will help buyers envision how they can make your home theirs.</p>
<h3>Step 3 &#8211; Let there be light.</h3>
<p>If you have curtains, open them up! If you have shutters, unlatch them! If you don’t have any window treatments, investing in even the cheapest sheers will accent the natural light that floods in. Walking into a bright and airy home makes it feel cozy and inviting.</p>
<h3>Step 4 &#8211; Leave No Room for Improvement</h3>
<ul>
<li>Give your home a facelift! If you have any tacky memorabilia, now’s the time to get rid of it. Personal items tie into this one too. Remove family photos and awards to make the home more neutral when buyers walk in.</li>
<li>Time to Feng Shui! Rearrange your furniture in a way that will create more space and functionality. You might want to even consider replacing big furniture with smaller pieces or pieces that allow you to hide your belongings like a ladder bookcase or a storage ottoman.</li>
<li>More updates! Nobody wants to travel back in time and have a crazy colored refrigerator! If your home has dated carpet or wallpaper you’re more likely to have a hard time selling. Potential buyers tend to look at homes that need little work done after the purchase. Think of what’s currently in style and what can be replaced! This can also add more value to your home upfront.</li>
<li>Freshen up your entryway! If your budget allows for a whole new paint job, do it! Buyers will appreciate it especially if your home is more than a decade old. If not, don’t worry. Putting a fresh coat of paint on just the front door will take you places. Sprucing up hedges, the lawn, or laying down new rock, if you have no grass, can become a magnet from other listings that may be in the area!</li>
</ul>
<p>Plan these steps into listing your home and you’ll be on the road to successfully sell your home. You get what you put in, after all!</p>

		<p>Cleaning a fireplace is usually one of those items that is overlooked, even in a deep home cleaning. It is important to regularly clean the fireplace as the leftover build up from fires can become toxic and can potentially harm your family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Cleaning the inside of a Fireplace</h2>
<p><strong>Wait at least 24 hours since the last time the fireplace has been used.</strong></p>
<h3>Supplies Needed:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Plastic tarp</li>
<li>Old Towels or Sheets</li>
<li>Apron</li>
<li>Handheld Broom and Dust Pan</li>
<li>Vacuum</li>
<li>Trash Bags</li>
</ul>
<h3>STEP 1:  Prepare the Area</h3>
<p>Lay a plastic tarp around and in front of the fireplace area. If you do not have a plastic tarp, old towels will do. Also, make sure to wear an apron and protective gloves. You may also want to wear old clothes as soot and dirt can be difficult to get off. If you have furniture close by it may also be a good idea to place sheets or towels over the surfaces to protect it.</p>
<h3>STEP 2: Remove debris</h3>
<p>First take out any metal grates that may be in the fireplace. Next, take any wood, tinder, or debris from the fireplace. We suggest wearing protective gloves to do this. Using a handheld broom sweep any dirt, debris or soot up and place it in a waste bin.</p>
<h3>STEP 3: Get the small bits!</h3>
<p>If necessary use a vacuum to pick up any remaining ash. Then throw away the debris into an outside bin.</p>
<h2>Spot Clean the Brick on a Fireplace</h2>
<h3>Supplies Needed:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cream of Tartar</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Old Tooth Brush</li>
<li>Rag</li>
</ul>
<h3>STEP 1: Make your mixture</h3>
<p>Mix two tablespoons of cream of tartar with a little water to make a paste.</p>
<h3>STEP 2:  Apply</h3>
<p>Spread the paste on the brick with an old toothbrush. Then wait for ten minutes to let the paste sit.</p>
<h3>STEP 3: Wash</h3>
<p>After ten minutes use warm water and a rag to wash off the paste. If necessary apply more past and repeat steps.</p>
<h2>Detailed Cleaning of Larger Brick Areas</h2>
<h3>Supplies Needed:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Baking Soda</li>
<li>Dish Soap</li>
<li>Tooth brush and/or larger scrub brush</li>
<li>Dish Cloth</li>
</ul>
<h3>STEP 1: Make your paste</h3>
<p>Make a thin paste that is easy to spread by mixing 3 tablespoons dish soap with a half cup of baking soda. You can add more dish soap if the paste is too thick.</p>
<h3>STEP 2: Dip and Scrub</h3>
<p>Dip the scrub brush into the paste you have just made. Make circular motions on the brick surfaces inside and/or outside of the fireplace. When all brick surfaces of the fireplace are covered, let sit for five minutes.</p>
<h3>STEP 3: Rinse!</h3>
<p>After the paste has sat for five minutes, rinse the paste off with a cloth and warm water.</p>
<h3>STEP 4: Repeat</h3>
<p>Repeat from step one as needed.</p>
<h2>Cleaning Fireplace Glass</h2>
<h3>Supplies Needed:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stove Glass cleaner</li>
<li>Soft Dish Clothes (3 or more)</li>
<li>Water</li>
</ul>
<h3>STEP 1: Check before you start</h3>
<p>Be sure the glass has already cooled and that the inside of the fireplace has been vacuumed and cleaned out.</p>
<h3>STEP 2: Spray</h3>
<p>Get one of the clothes damp with warm water. Spray some of the stove glass cleaner onto the damp cloth.</p>
<h3>STEP 3</h3>
<p>Next rub the cloth over the fireplace glass focusing on the stained areas. Once again, use circular motions as well as back and forth motions. You may need to apply some pressure to get hard stains to come off.</p>
<h3>STEP 4</h3>
<p>Continue to apply more cleaner to the cloth and continue circular and back to forth motions until all stains have been removed.</p>
<h3>STEP 5</h3>
<p>After all stains have been removed take a new damp cloth and wipe the surfaces clean.</p>
<h3>STEP 6</h3>
<p>Lastly, take your last clean cloth and dry the glass so that there are no streaks.</p>
<p>That’s it!</p>

		<p>Cleaning ann oven usually involves harsh chemicals that create fumes and an unsafe environment for your family. We detailed a safe way to clean your oven with everyday products you likely have already in your home. All you need is a few items and a little elbow grease! I will list two options depending on the type of oven you have in your home.</p>
<h2>How to Clean a Self-Cleaning Oven</h2>
<p><strong>SUPPLIES NEEDED:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Dish Soap</li>
<li>Sponge</li>
<li>Vinegar</li>
<li>Small Brush and Dust Pan</li>
<li>2 or 3 Gentle Clothes</li>
</ul>
<p>STEP 1</p>
<p>Choose a time when the kitchen is not being used. Open windows and possibly doors to ventilate the room so that fumes do not bother family members. Make sure you will be home for the length of the self-clean. (The average self-clean cycle can last 3 to 6 hours)</p>
<p>STEP 2</p>
<p>Remove the oven racks and any other objects you have inside the oven. Set them aside. Place oven racks in the sink with warm water and a few drops of dish soap to soak. Vinegar and hot water can also be used as a soaking solution.</p>
<p>STEP 3</p>
<p>Turn on the oven’s self-cleaning mode. The oven door should then lock. If the oven door does not lock, place tape over the door or use another barrier to make sure that family members will not be able to open the door. During a cleaning cycle the oven will reach between 800 and 900 degrees Fahrenheit. The cycle will turn any food and grease into gray ash.</p>
<p>STEP 4</p>
<p>Wait at least two hours after the oven’s self-cleaning cycle has finished in order to let the oven cool down. Once it has cooled completely, sweep any ash out of the oven with a small brush and dustpan. Next use a damp cloth to wipe the oven clean. You can use a vinegar and water solution to dampen the cloth.</p>
<p>If the oven is extra dirty you may need to continue reading and scrub the oven with the solutions below under “Non-Self Cleaning Oven”. If the oven is now clean, continue.</p>
<p>STEP 5</p>
<p>After you have let the oven racks soak, scrub any extra food or grease off of each rack with a sponge. Rinse the racks and dry them with a clean towel. Then place them back inside the oven.</p>
<p>STEP 6</p>
<p>Clean the seals of the oven as well as the exterior oven door with a gentle cloth and hydrogen peroxide. This can also be done periodically to keep the door clean. And that’s it!</p>
<h2>How to Clean a Non-Self-Cleaning Oven</h2>
<p><strong>SUPPLIES NEEDED:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Baking soda</li>
<li>Rubber gloves</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Rubber gloves</li>
<li>Damp dishcloth</li>
<li>Plastic or silicone spatula</li>
<li>Spray bottle</li>
<li>White vinegar</li>
</ul>
<p>STEP 1</p>
<p>Remove the oven racks and any other objects you have inside the oven. Set them aside. Place oven racks in the sink with warm water and a few drops of dish soap to soak. Vinegar and hot water can also be used as a soaking solution.</p>
<p>STEP 2</p>
<p>Remove the oven racks and any other objects you have inside the oven. Set them aside. Place oven racks in the sink with warm water and a few drops of dish soap to soak. Vinegar and hot water can also be used as a soaking solution.</p>
<p>STEP 3</p>
<p>Make a baking soda paste. Mix ½ cup of baking soda with a few tablespoons of water in a bowl. Usually, 3 or 4 tablespoons of water make a great spreadable paste.</p>
<p>STEP 4</p>
<p>Use a sponge to spread the baking soda paste over the interior surfaces of your oven. Make sure to be aware of heating elements. This would be a great time to put on those rubber gloves in case your oven is full of grease and grime. The baking soda paste may turn a brownish color which is perfectly okay. Make sure to get all the nooks and crannies.</p>
<p>STEP 5</p>
<p>Let the paste sit in the oven overnight or approximately 12 hours.</p>
<p>STEP 6</p>
<p>Use a damp gentle cloth and wipe out the oven. You may need to use a plastic or silicone spatula with a little bit of elbow grease for those hard area.</p>
<p>STEP 7</p>
<p>Now fill a spray bottle with vinegar and spray the areas you still see baking soda. This will create a reaction and the baking soda will foam, making it easier to remove.</p>
<p>STEP 8</p>
<p>Do a final wipe down, removing the last bit of foam and solution from your oven. Use a clean damp cloth and possibly more vinegar to make the surfaces shiny.</p>
<p>STEP 9</p>
<p>Place the clean oven racks back inside the oven.</p>
<p>That’s it!!!</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			
<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
	<div class="wpb_wrapper">
		<p>VINEGAR</p>
<p>Vinegar is by far one of the most versatile cleaning agents. Use it to remove soap scum from the shower. Mix it with borax to get rid of hard-water rings in the toilet. Tape a bag of vinegar to your shower head and leave it overnight for an easy, sparkly clean; or add a couple of tablespoons of white vinegar to your dish soap to eliminate grease in the kitchen.</p>
<p>HYDROGEN PEROXIDE</p>
<p>You use your toothbrush to clean your teeth, but don’t forget about cleaning your toothbrush. Let it soak in hydrogen peroxide for a few minutes to get rid of any lingering germs. Hydrogen peroxide is also useful on many hard surfaces. Use it to scrub your toilet, trash cans, shower, mirrors and doorknob. You can even mix it with equal parts water for a safe and effective solution for mopping the bathroom and kitchen floors.</p>
<p>LEMONS</p>
<p>The acid in lemons makes them a great natural cleanser. The juice is great for disinfecting kitchen countertops and cutting boards. Cut a lemon in half and scrub your bath and shower to remove soap scum. And if your shaving cream has left a rusty ring in your bathtub, use your lemon half to scrub it away.</p>
<p>VODKA</p>
<p>Do you have a mold and mildew problem in the bathroom? Skip a trip to the store, and pull out some inexpensive vodka from the liquor cabinet. Spray it directly onto the mold and mildew, and wait 15 minutes. Then use a cloth or small scrubbing brush to wipe it clean. And don’t forget to save a little for an after-cleaning celebration!</p>
<p>TEA</p>
<p>More than a favorite beverage, brewed tea can be used to clean windows, mirrors and countertops. Spray on your bathroom surfaces just as you would any typical window or surface cleaner. Then, keep your bags to hide in the back of the fridge. They will actually work to deodorize it. And if you need to remove the scent of onion, garlic or fish from your hands, cut a bag open, and wash your hands with the leaves to remove the odor.</p>
<p>SALT</p>
<p>Remember that miracle lemon that cleaned the tub? If your dirt stains are particularly stubborn, add some salt to the lemon, and scrub the surface of your bathtub, sink or toilet. Once your salt solution has done the trick, just rinse off any pulp and leftover residue, leaving your bathroom perfectly clean with a lemon-fresh scent!</p>
<p>BAKING SODA</p>
<p>Perfect for cleaning counters, sinks, drains, the toilet bowl, soap scum, shower doors, shower heads, and well, pretty much anything in the kitchen and bathroom, baking soda is one cleaning agent you don’t want to be without. For most kitchen and bathroom surfaces, a simple paste made of baking soda and water will do the trick.</p>
<p>DRAIN CLEANER</p>
<p>Though it is not a natural cleaning solution, exactly, a drain snake is an eco-friendly way to clean out the main source of drain blockage: hair. And if you don’t have a drain snake, you can still avoid pouring harsh chemicals down the bathtub drain by unwinding a wire hanger, hooking the end, pushing it down the drain as far as it will go, and pulling up hair that is keeping the water from draining properly.</p>

		<h2>House Cleaning in Phoenix</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s that time of year again in Phoenix, Arizona where many households are gearing up for a busy fall schedule. Kids are going to school, off to college, and work seems to always be demanding more and more time. It&#8217;s also that time of year where Phoenix experiences a lot of weather changes, from monsoons in August to the perfect weather in October. Essentials Cleaner is here to help with getting your cleaning schedule up and going to help easy the burden of your busy schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Here are a few tips on building a schedule for House Cleaning in Phoenix</strong></p>
<p>Home cleaning is a lot of work and it is easy to lose track and end up with a dirty home in only a matter of days. But house cleaning does not need to be difficult! If you plan out a clenaing schedule for your home, it will help you to keep the house clean without needing to put in those long cleaning Saturdays. With a cleaning routine, your house will not be perfect at once, but it will be clean most of the time. Keeping a clean home take time, repetition, and someone to complete the tasks. Here is a suggested cleaning schedule you can start with:</p>
<p>MONDAY [BATHROOMS]: Clean all your bathrooms. This includes cleaning the mirrors, counters, sinks, faucets, toilets, showers, and tubs. Make sure you wipe your way out of the bathroom to leave a clean floor.</p>
<p>TUESDAY [DUST]: Start at the top and dust your way down. It is usually best to use a microfiber cloth for the areas you can reach. For those higher surfaces, you may need an duster with an extension. Be sure to start at the top though! Otherwise, you will be creating more cleaning work for yourself.</p>
<p>WEDNESDAY [VACUUM]: Vacuum all the floors in your home. It can be quick and simple if you keep up on this task. Make sure you take the time to get all of the corners and crevices though.</p>
<p>THURSDAY [WASH FLOORS]: Wash all the floors in your home with a good product.</p>
<p>FRIDAY [SHEETS &amp; TOWELS]: Wash all the sheets and towels. Put the sheets back on beds and put towels away. This will help keep your bathrooms and beds smelling clean and fresh.</p>
<p>SATURDAY [REAL CLEANING]: Find any areas that are &#8220;getting behind&#8221; and get to work. Saturday is often times a good day to catch up on any tasks you didn’t get a chance to complete.</p>
<p>SUNDAY [NOTHING]: Relax and enjoy your day.</p>
<p>Want an Alternative to a Cleaning? Maybe it&#8217;s time for a house cleaning service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>6 Simple Ways to Make Your Closet Smell Good!</h2>
<p>Smells are very powerful. In fact, a smell gives either a great or an awful first impression. This gives the scent-status of your clothes a completely new level of importance!</p>
<p>If your closet or other areas in your home are not up to par on its smell, give a few of these tips a try:</p>
<p>1. Bar Soap<br />
Get a sweet smelling bar of soap and a storage container. Place folded clothes in the storage container. Then cover the clothes with a cloth such as a napkin or thin tablecloth. Make sure it is breathable. Set the soap on top. Close the lid and set the box aside. In about two to four hours, the clothes in the box will have absorbed the scent of the soap. You may also place the soap on the shelf and allow it to do its thing. The stronger soaps work best for this.</p>
<p>2. Perfume<br />
Perfume usually won’t make a bad smell go away, but it can cover up any stale smell. Spray your favorite perfume onto a few cotton swabs and then place them on a closet shelf or in drawers where your clothes can absorb the sent. Another option is to place the cotton ball into your pocket for the day.</p>
<p>3. Coffee Grounds<br />
Does your closet stink? Coffee grounds absorb foul odors; so placing a can of coffee grounds in your closet will eliminate the bad smell. Simply poke a few holes in a container, close the lid and store it in your closet. Once a month, switch out the can.</p>
<p>4. Essential Spray<br />
Making your own smelly spray is easy, simply grab a spray bottle and your favorite essential oil. Add a few drops of essential oils to the spray bottle, and then fill the rest of the bottle with water. Lightly spray your clothes with the spray. Or, if you don’t fill like DIYing your spray, you can always buy a quick and easy lavender spray at most grocery stores. Then you’re ready to go!</p>
<p>5.Wood Scented<br />
Have you ever noticed how great wood smells? Well, you can make your clothes smell like that very easily. Just grab a small piece of wood and stash it in your closet or dresser drawer. Try Home Depot, a specialty hardware store or a local lumberyard to find the perfect piece of wood for your closet.</p>
<p>6. Vinegar<br />
Can’t find any clean clothes in your home? We’ve all been there. First, turn the dirty garment that you must wear inside out. Mix equal parts vinegar and water into a spray bottle. Spray a small amount onto the fabric. Make sure to get areas like the armpits that can be especially smelly. Don’t worry that you’ll smell like vinegar. The smell will go away and the fabric will dry within minutes, and you’re good to go!</p>
